        <h2>The Begin</h2>

        <p>
          It all started a cold afternoon of november, 2019. The three friends
          met the two co-players of their former band and went for their first
          beer. That made the job, they agreed that they would agitate the
          waters of metal scene with their blasting beats. Two shredding
          guitars, a sharp-knife bass, maniac drum beats and vocals that even
          the god of thunder would be jealous of.
        </p>

        <h2>In the meanwhile</h2>
        <p>
          Life was going well for Undervault, music was flowing and the beer was
          not ending. Until the great time for their singer came and had to move
          to Scotland to extend his musical knowledge. This was a great loss for
          the band that only one person could fill, Sofia Kostoglou! Her vocal
          range ripped their ears apart while embracing themselves. The road was
          open for new arrangements and composicial oasis!

        <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
        <p>
          The band is already touring around Europe and on 27th of January there
          is a show at Wembley stadium. All the tickets have been sold so don't
          look for one! The opening band will be the Friendzone who will play
          three songs for about fifteen minutes. Be there!
