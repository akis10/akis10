        <h1>The Begin</h1>
        <p>
          It all started a cold afternoon of november, 2019. The three friends
          met<br />
          the two co-players of their former band and went for their first
          beer.<br />
          That made the job, they agreed that they would agitate the waters of
          metal scene<br />
          with their blasting beats. Two shredding guitars, a sharp-knife bass,
          maniac drum beats<br />
          and vocals that even the god of thunder would be jealous of.
        </p>

      <div class="career">
        <h1>In the meanwhile</h1>
        <p>
          Life was going well for Undervault, music was flowing<br />
          and the beer was not ending. Until the great time for their<br />
          singer came and had to move to Scotland to extend his musical<br />
          knowledge. This was a great loss for the band that only one<br />
          person could fill, Sofia Kostoglou! Her vocal range ripped their<br />
          ears apart while embracing themselves. The road was open for<br />
          new arrangements and composicial oasis!
        </p>

      <div class="upcoming">
        <h1>Upcoming Events</h1>
        <p>
          The band is already touring around Europe and on 27th<br />
          of December there is a show at Wembley stadium. All the<br />
          tickets have been sold so don't look for one! The opening <br />
          band will be the Friendzone who will play three songs<br />
          for about fifteen minutes. Be there!
        </p>
